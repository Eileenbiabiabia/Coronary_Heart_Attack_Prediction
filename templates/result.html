                <p>
                    Body mass index (BMI) is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of their height in meters. 
                    BMI is an easy screening method for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obese.
                    BMI does not measure body fat directly but provides a reasonable body fat estimate.

                    To maintain healthy cholesterol levels and promote cardiovascular health, prioritize foods rich in dietary fiber such as oats, beans, and apples. 
                    These foods can help stabilize cholesterol levels and reduce the accumulation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). 
                    Additionally, aim to consume at three five servings of vegetables and fruits daily.

                <p>
                    Blood pressure is the force exerted by your blood against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood throughout your body; 
                    Essentially, it's the pressure of blood flowing through your arteries, and if consistently too high (known as hypertension), it can damage your blood vessels and organs, potentially leading to serious health complications like heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease.
